Simple Brake Bias Simhub Overlay

This is a simple brake bias overlay so that you can keep an easy eye on your brake bias settings.

READ THIS OR YOU WILL THINK IT IS BROKEN...

There is a descrepancy between the Black Box bias setting and what I am getting from telemetry.  I had to subtract 5.5 from the telemetry reading to get it close so you will see rounding errors that will make the reading a tenth off sometimes.  The overlay is close enough to give you a pretty good reading on where you are at for brake bias none the less.


As usual, extract the files into the C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\DashTemplates directory.
