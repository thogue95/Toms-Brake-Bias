Simple Brake Bias Simhub Overlay

This is a simple brake bias overlay so that you can keep an easy eye on your brake bias settings.

READ THIS OR YOU WILL THINK IT IS BROKEN...

I have only been running NextGens lately and came across an issue with the In-car Black Box Brake Bias brake reporting.  When the master cylinders are set the same, the black box will report a brake bias that feels correct and is inline with what this dashboard reports.  Once the master cylinders are no longer set the same, the In-car Black Box Brake Bias and this dashboard no longer report the same number.  Try it yourself and set the master cylinders to the the opposite max settings and you will see a drastic difference.  When you drive the car, you will see that the dashboard reporting matches how the car drives.  


As usual, extract the files into the C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\DashTemplates directory.
